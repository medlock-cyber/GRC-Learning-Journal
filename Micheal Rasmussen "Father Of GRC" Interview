## 🔑 Key Topics Discussed
1. Michael Rasmussen's definition of GRC as a capability, not a tool

## 💬 Quotes to Remember
> "GRC is a capability to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity."  
> "Every organization is a Starship of risk. It’s not about avoiding risk—it’s about managing the right ones." — Michael Rasmussen

---

## 📈 Practical Applications
- Apply **objective-driven control selection** to SSP/SAR documentation  
- Reframe risk assessments to consider **strategic and ethical implications**  
- Use this mindset when configuring GRC tools like ServiceNow or Archer  

---

## 📥 Action Items
- [ ] Read the **OCEG GRC Capability Model**  
- [ ] Align GRC documentation to business objectives  
- [ ] Watch a FedVTE module on mission/business process integration in RMF

## 📘 OCEG GRC Capability Model – Overview

The **OCEG GRC Capability Model** is a globally recognized framework designed to help organizations integrate Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) into a unified, effective capability.

> ✅ **Purpose:** To enable organizations to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty, and act with integrity.

---

## 🔑 Core Objectives

- Align GRC activities with **organizational strategy**
- Break down silos between risk, compliance, audit, and ethics
- Establish a repeatable process to manage obligations and performance
- Guide organizations toward **continuous improvement** of GRC capabilities

## 🧱 GRC Capability Components (The GRC Wheel)

| Phase   | Description                                                                    |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Learn**   | Understand internal and external context: stakeholders, risks, obligations |
| **Align**   | Set governance structures, roles, culture, and objectives                  | 
| **Perform** | Implement controls, processes, and procedures to meet goals                |
| **Review**  | Monitor performance and compliance; improve processes continuously         |

---

## 📚 Why It Matters

- Promotes **integration** of risk, compliance, security, ethics, and audit  
- Focuses on **value-driven GRC** instead of checkbox compliance  
- Enhances alignment with frameworks like **NIST RMF, ISO 31000, COSO ERM**, etc.  
- Helps mature your GRC program in a scalable, adaptable way

## 🔐 Reflecting on Breach Events to Justify Privacy Controls

## 🎯 Why It Matters

Referencing recent data breaches strengthens your business case for privacy controls by:
- Demonstrating **real-world risk relevance**
- Supporting **justification of control implementation**
- Showing awareness of emerging threats during **risk assessments**, **ATO packages**, or **continuous monitoring**

## 🔍 Real Breach Events to Reference (2023–2025)

| Breach/Event                          | Summary                                                         | Privacy Lessons                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MOVEit Transfer (2023)**            | Exploited zero-day vulnerability in file transfer software      | Justifies secure file handling (AC-17), patching (SI-2), and encryption (SC-12) |
| **T-Mobile (2023 breach + prior)**    | Repeated PII breaches due to weak encryption and access control | Reinforces need for SC-12, AC-6, AU-2                                           |
| **Meta (Facebook)**                   | Hefty fines for mismanagement of user consent and tracking      | Supports governance and privacy notices (PL-8, AR family controls)              |
| **SolarWinds (supply chain breach)**  | Attack on software update process                               | Encourages supply chain vetting and privacy impact assessments                  |

---

## 📈 Sample GRC Justification (SAR or SSP Insert)

> _“Given high-profile incidents like MOVEit and T-Mobile, where inadequate encryption and weak access controls led to significant personal data loss, 
the implementation of privacy-enhancing controls such as SC-12, SC-28, and AC-6 is essential for risk reduction and mission assurance.”_
