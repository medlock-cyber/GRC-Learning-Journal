## 🔑 Key Topics Discussed
1. Importance of a flexible data model in GRC  
2. Centralizing and normalizing data for better insights  
3. Enabling scalability and continuous monitoring  

---

## 🧠 Takeaways / Lessons Learned
- Flexible data models help adapt to changing compliance needs. A Data model is the underlying architecture that underpins any GRC program. 
- Breaking down data silos improves visibility and risk response. Since the world we live in is constantly changing, it is important to be able to grow and expand as technology improves.
- Flexibility means being able to put a program in place on day one, without a final version of where its going. It can change and adapt to changing requirements along the way.
  Better modeling = better reporting, decision-making, and audit readiness.
