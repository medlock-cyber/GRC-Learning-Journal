# üéß GRC & Me ‚Äì Episode Notes

## Podcast Info
- **Podcast Title:** GRC & Me (LogicGate)
- **Episode Title:** The Benefits of a Flexible Data Model w/ Matt Kunkel 
- **Date Listened:** July 23, 2025  
- **Host / Guest(s):** *(Meghan Maneval / Matt Kunkel)*  
- **Length:** *18 min*
- **Release Date** May 22, 2019

## üîë Key Topics Discussed
1. Importance of a flexible data model in GRC  
2. Centralizing and normalizing data for better insights  
3. Enabling scalability and continuous monitoring  

---

## üß† Takeaways / Lessons Learned
- Flexible data models help adapt to changing compliance needs. A Data model is the underlying architecture that underpins any GRC program. 
- Breaking down data silos improves visibility and risk response. Since the world we live in is constantly changing, it is important to be able to grow and expand as technology improves.
- Flexibility means being able to put a program in place on day one, without a final version of where its going. It can change and adapt to changing requirements along the way.
  Better modeling = better reporting, decision-making, and audit readiness.

## üìö Terms, Tools, & Frameworks Mentioned
- Flexible Data Model  
- Control Inheritance  
- Centralized Risk Register  
- Tools (e.g., ServiceNow GRC, RSA Archer)

## üí¨ Quotes / Memorable Points
> ‚ÄúThe more flexible your data is, the more agile your GRC strategy becomes.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúYour model shouldn‚Äôt just store data‚Äîit should tell a story about risk.‚Äù

---

## üìà Practical Applications
- Apply centralized risk inventory model in global GRC project  
- Research how eMASS and other tools handle flexible data  
- Reflect this model in updated SSP/SAR structure  

---

## üì• Action Items
- [x] Explore eMASS data modeling capabilities  
- [x] Add centralized control mapping structure to documentation  
- [x] Watch FedVTE lessons on continuous monitoring  
- [x] Compare data structures in RSA Archer vs ServiceNow

## üîê In an RMF Environment
   
Flexible Data Models can help you:
- Categorize Systems based on dynamic asset/group
- Select and Implement controls across multiple systems
- Assess reusable environments (e.g., China vs US sites) from a unified platform

---

## üõ† Common GRC Tools That Use Flexible Models
- ServiveNow GRC - Relational model with dynamic control and risk mapping
- RSA Archer - Fully confirgurable applications with linkable data objects
- Xacta - Used for RMF workflows with flexible conrol inheritance
- eMASS - More rigid, but newer implementations allow better integration

---

## üîç Key Concepts to Explore
- Data Normalization - Organize data into reusable sets (control families, common threats
- Object-Oriented Modeling - Think of systems, risks, controls, etc, as connected "objects"
- Tags/Metadata - Support dynamic filtering, sorting, and dashboard creation
- Schema-on-Read - You dont need to structure all data upfront; it adapts at query time
  (raw data), and deciding how to organize them only when you're to study (query).
- Schema-on-Read allows GRC tools to adapt without rebuilding the whole database.
